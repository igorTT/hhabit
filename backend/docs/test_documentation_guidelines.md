# Test Documentation Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the standards and best practices for documenting tests in the HealthHabit project. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, maintainability, and clarity in our test suite.

## Test File Structure

### File Naming
- Test files should be prefixed with `test_`
- Test files should be placed in a `tests` directory
- Test files should mirror the structure of the source code

Example:
```
backend/
├── src/
│   └── services/
│       └── habit_service.py
└── tests/
    └── unit/
        └── services/
            └── test_habit_service.py
```

### Test Class/Module Documentation
Each test file should have a module-level docstring explaining:
- The purpose of the test suite
- The components being tested
- Any important setup or teardown requirements

Example:
```python
"""
Test suite for the HabitService class.
Tests the CRUD operations and business logic for habit management.
Requires a clean database state for each test.
"""
```

### Test Function Documentation
Each test function should have a docstring that follows this structure:
1. A brief description of what is being tested
2. The expected behavior
3. Any important preconditions or assumptions
4. Any important postconditions

Example:
```python
def test_create_habit():
    """
    Test creating a new habit.
    
    Expected behavior:
    - Habit is created with provided data
    - ID and timestamps are automatically generated
    - Default values are set correctly
    
    Preconditions:
    - Database is empty
    - Valid habit data is provided
    
    Postconditions:
    - Habit is persisted in the database
    - All fields are correctly set
    """
```

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on specific functionality
- Should be fast and independent

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Use real dependencies where appropriate
- Focus on workflows and scenarios
- May be slower than unit tests

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Use real external services
- Focus on user experience
- May be slow and require setup

## Test Data Management

### Fixtures
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup
- Document fixture dependencies
- Keep fixtures focused and reusable

Example:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def habit_service():
    """
    Creates a test instance of HabitService.
    
    Returns:
        HabitService: A clean instance for testing
        
    Note:
        Cleans up after each test
    """
    service = HabitService()
    yield service
    service.cleanup()
```

### Test Data
- Use meaningful test data
- Document data requirements
- Consider edge cases

## Assertions

### Best Practices
- Use descriptive assertion messages
- Test one concept per assertion
- Use appropriate assertion types
- Document complex assertions

Example:
```python
def test_habit_validation():
    """
    Test habit data validation.
    
    Verifies that:
    - Name cannot be empty
    - Frequency must be valid
    - Target value must be positive
    """
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Name cannot be empty"):
        HabitCreate(name="", frequency="daily")
```

## Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage
- Unit tests: 80% coverage
- Integration tests: 60% coverage
- Critical paths: 100% coverage

### Coverage Exclusions
- Generated code
- Configuration files
- Error handling paths that are impossible to trigger

## Documentation Quality Metrics

### Fitness Function
The following metrics are used to evaluate documentation quality:

1. Completeness (0-100%)
   - All test files have module docstrings
   - All test functions have docstrings
   - All fixtures are documented

2. Clarity (0-100%)
   - Documentation is clear and concise
   - Technical terms are explained
   - Examples are provided where helpful

3. Structure (0-100%)
   - Documentation follows the standard format
   - Sections are properly organized
   - Dependencies are clearly stated

4. Maintainability (0-100%)
   - Documentation is up to date
   - No redundant information
   - Easy to update

The overall fitness score is calculated as:
```
fitness_score = (completeness + clarity + structure + maintainability) / 4
```

A minimum fitness score of 80% is required for all test documentation.

## Tools and Automation

### Documentation Generation
- Use pytest-doc to generate test documentation
- Run documentation checks as part of CI/CD
- Automatically update coverage reports

### Linting
- Use pylint for Python code
- Use flake8 for style checking
- Use mypy for type checking

## Review Process

### Code Review
- Documentation is reviewed alongside code
- Reviewers check for:
  - Completeness
  - Clarity
  - Accuracy
  - Adherence to guidelines

### Updates
- Documentation should be updated when:
  - Adding new tests
  - Modifying existing tests
  - Changing test requirements
  - Updating dependencies
